# snowflake-fbprohet-lab
 
Lab on Snowflake and FB Prophet

## Getting Started

This lab is based on an original one created by Snowflake (see PDF). Although the notebook is deployed using AWS Sagemaker, it can certainly be deployed on a standalone Jupyter one.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Snowflake account - a 30-day trial account was used
* (Optional) AWS account, if using Sagemaker

Additionally, the Python environment must have:
```
pystan
fbprophet
snowflake-connector-python
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
plotly
```
It is strongly recommended to use `conda` (or `miniconda`).
